PRINTF MANUAL PAGE

NAME:
      _printf - formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS:
        #include "main.h"

        int _printf(const char *format, ...)

DESCRIPTION:
	The functions in the printf() family produce output according to
	a format as described below.  The function printf()
	write output to stdout, the standard output stream

Format of the format string
       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
       its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
       of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
       are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
       specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
       subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
       introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
       specifier.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
       flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and
       an optional length modifier.

   Conversion specifiers
       A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
       The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
	
	d, i   The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

	c    The argument is converted to an char, and the resulting character is written.

	s - The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, these functions return the number of
       characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
       strings).

	If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

BUGS:
	This program doesn't handle adding flags, fields, precision, or length modifiers.

EXAMPLE:

	#include "main.h"

	/**
	*main - using function crated, print a string of characters
	*
	*Return: 0 if successful
	*/
	int main(void)
	{
	
	_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
	return (0)
	}
	
OUTPUT:
	String:[I am a string !]
